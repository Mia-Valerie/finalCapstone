This project uses Natural Language Processing to compare the descriptions of films and recommend a next film.
The progamme requires a movies.txt file with the descriptions af film options.
Running the programme will print the film recommendation must similar to the description of The Hulk. 
The film description the program compares to txt file can be changed in line 11 by swapping out the description text for the desciption of a diffrent film.
This program uses spaCy and en_core_web_md for it's natural language processing, so can only handle film desciptions in english, this can however be changed in line 3.
